#Tutte Polynomial Evaluator 

This is a port of David Pearce's Tutte Polynomial solver to Java.

While it should currenly correctly evaluate Tutte Polynomials for arbitrary graphs, the implementation is not particularly fast. In particular the implemenation of canonical labelling of graphs is slow and requires work before the implementation will have a reasonable runtime.
